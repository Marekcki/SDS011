# SDS011 dust sensor library
Just another SDS011 dust sensor library. 

This library is a reimplementation of existing ones to fit my needs. Parts of the code come from other projects, see [References](#References).

## Hint
 * the UART documentation is very limited. If you have more informations, especially for commands and thair responses let me know
 * library was testet with NodeMCU (ESP8266), but should work on compatible arduino platforms
